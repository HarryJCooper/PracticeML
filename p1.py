# THIS IS A SINGLE NEURON, EVERY INPUT HAS A WEIGHT, BUT ONLY ONE BIAS/NEURON

# THE INPUT LAYER IS JUST THE VALUES YOU PUT IN

# THE OUTPUT NEURONS 

# IN MATHEMATICS A LIST IS A VECTOR
# A LIST OF LISTS IS A 2D ARRAY
# A MATRIX IS JUST A RECTANGULAR ARRAY
# A LIST OF VECTORS IS A MATRIX
# A LIST OF LISTS OF LISTS IS A 3D ARRAY
# A TENSOR IS AN OBJECT THAT CAN BE REPRESENTED AS AN ARRAY

# the dot_product e.g a . b = [1, 2, 3] . [2, 3, 4] = 1 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 4 = 20
# the dot_product of two vectors (lists) results in a single scalar value
# a scaler value is a value that only has one component to it
